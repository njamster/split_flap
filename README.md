# <img src="./icon.png" width="24px"> SplitFlap

A control that emulates a [split-flap display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display). It steps through a fixed array of characters (predefined by the user) until it reaches the target character. Each character gets vertically split into two halves, and when the current character changes, the upper half will drop down.
